# minilinter
In this project, you will use what you know about iterating over arrays to improve the quality of a paragraph and gather some information about that paragraph.  This is the same type of work that word processing software does. Additionally, you may have heard of linting, a process by which text is evaluated and improved by an application. In this project, you will create a miniature version of a linter using array methods that you have learned.
